    <p>Checkpoint workflow solutions blend step-by-step guidance with easy-to-use graphical workflows and tools in common but complex areas. To provide best practice processes, you can link directly to related commentary, calculators, checklists, flowcharts, form and templates.</p>
    <p>Each Workflow Solution has two main components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Workflow Navigation Map:</strong><br>
        Workflows provide guidance on a subject area, where items are broken down step by step. Each item provides a more detailed graphical outline of the key components from which the user can link to relevant sources such as legislation, commentary, news or interactive tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow tools</strong><br>
        The Tools provides a variety of time-saving online tools to help you find and organise information and forecast and manage business scenarios. You have the ability to save tools, export tools and customise them for specific clients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have designed workflows to be easy to use. There are several supporting features which will aid in navigating around workflow.</p>
    <p>These features are made available once you click through to a navigation schematic or workflow tool and include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document in Context</strong><br>
        Shows the relative location of the document in the Workflow Table of Contents</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow Tools</strong><br>
            Provides direct access to all the tools referenced in the current document
        </li>
        <li><strong>Related Documents</strong><br>
        Provides direct access to all the sources which include commentary, legislation and news items that are referenced in the current document</li>
        <li><strong>Recently accessed Documents
            </strong><br>
        Provides an audit trail of the last 6 documents accessed in the site.</li>
    </ul>
