# Upgrading

### The Quick Way

Simply create a new stylesheet or Javascript and link to it in the master.html. These files can store quick fixes and time sensitive updates. At a later time, they can be absorbed into the Sass files and recompiled with a **grunt build**.

In future, when updates are made relating to CSS, JS, fonts or images - one only needs to copy over the **dist/assets** folder from the remote repo to receive the updates.
