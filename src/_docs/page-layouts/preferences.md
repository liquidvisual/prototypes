# Preferences

The output of preferences appears to work fine when dropped directly into the content stage of the Application Frame.

Some basic styling has been applied to override some aspects but it's mostly taken care of with Foundation's form styles.

## Whitespace Issue

An concern brought up with Westlaw is there was too much whitespace. This can be reduced by tweaking the output to include less `<br>` tags which is a better way to go than manually overriding every style with CSS.
