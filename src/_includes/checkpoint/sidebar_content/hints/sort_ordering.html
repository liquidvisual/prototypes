<h4>How Sorting is Ordered</h4>

<p>Relevance is determined by two factors (1) the number of times your search terms appear in a document and (2) the proximity of those search terms to each other.</p>

<p>Weighted is based upon the location of the keywords in a document (hits). Hits found in one document field will be assigned priority (weighting) over hits in another document field.</p>

<p><strong>Note: All current documents will have precedence over archived documents</strong></p>
